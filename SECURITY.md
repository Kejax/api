# Reporting security issues
We take security very seriously and appreciate your efforts in responsibly disclosing your findings.
We will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions to the safety of the API.

To report a security issue related to either ArrowHead's API or the unofficial community wrapper, please use
Github Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/helldivers-2/api/security/advisories/new) tab.

This will notify the relevant maintainers and action will be taken as soon as possible.
We will also try to acknowledge receiving your report as soon as possible.
